Exploring the sunrise equation

The main question I had was whether it's troue that the sunrise and sunset time evolution has a 
slight phase shift, i.e. when the e.g. sunrise starts to happen earlier that the day before, the 
sunset continues to happen earlier than the day before. The answer is yes, this is indeed the 
case.

It is still not intuitively clear why the sunrise and the sunset times could have this phase 
shift.

Few helpful links:

Python code used for the simulation.

[Equation of Time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx9AJJSKIL4) - a YouTube video with a nice and 
clear visualisation of the effects of the Earth's orbit excentiricity and  Earth's axis tilt on 
the duration of the solar day.
